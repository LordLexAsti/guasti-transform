\begin{abstract}
We introduce the \textbf{Guasti Transform}, a novel geometric approach to analyzing the multiplicative properties of integers. By mapping divisors to angular coordinates on a discrete 2D grid, we define the "Angular Signature" of a number. This framework provides a visual criterion for primality and, through spectral analysis of the grid's angular distribution, exhibits resonance patterns consistent with the zeros of the Riemann Zeta function. This paper details the formalization of 15 years of intuitive research, consolidated via the TriadIA human-AI collaboration protocol.

\section{Introduction}
The distribution of prime numbers has traditionally been studied through analytic number theory. Here, we propose a geometric alternative. The \textit{Guasti Grid} $G$ is defined over $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ such that a point $(i,j)$ is active iff $i|j$.

\section{The Law of Cotangent}
We observe that the multiplication table of an integer $k$ forms a ray passing through the origin. We formalize this as the Law of Cotangent:
\begin{equation}
    \theta_k = \arctan\left(\frac{1}{k}\right)
\end{equation}
This mapping transforms the arithmetic problem of factorization into a geometric problem of angular decomposition.

\section{The Angular Signature Hypothesis}
\textbf{Definition:} The Angular Signature $S_A(n)$ of an integer $n$ is the set of angles corresponding to its divisors $D(n)$:
\begin{equation}
    S_A(n) = \{ \theta_d \mid d \in D(n) \}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Conjecture:} The mapping $n \mapsto S_A(n)$ is injective. Furthermore, the topological entropy of $S_A(n)$ is minimized when $n$ is prime.

\section{Spectral Analysis and Riemann Zeros}
By applying a transform to the distribution of angles across the grid, we observe constructive interference patterns. Preliminary numerical experiments suggest that the peaks of the \textit{Guasti Resonance Function} align with the imaginary parts of the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann Zeta function ($\zeta(s)$).

\section{Conclusion}
The Guasti Transform offers a rigorous bridge between geometry and arithmetic. While the exact analytic connection to $\zeta(s)$ requires further investigation, the experimental results validate the heuristic power of this geometric framework.
